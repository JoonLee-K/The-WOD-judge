# The-WOD-judge
The Crossfit WOD judge on your wrist.

# How it works
Judging WOD records by 

`combining sensor data in smart watch`(Apple Watch, Galaxy Watch.. etc.) and `prerecorded WOD data`.

# What's needed
- A bunch of sensor data from watch (Apple : CoreMotion | Google : TBA)
- Model and a bunch of training...
